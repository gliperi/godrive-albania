## Problem Identified: ##
After conducting a market analysis, our group discovered a lack of car rental software services in the region of Albania. Frequently, people in need of a car rental service spend the majority of their time scouring the Internet in search of different service providers, leaving them with less time to actually focus on making the best decision. This is especially true for tourists, or businessmen visiting our country, who are in need of a quick-and-easy solution.

## Proposed Solution: ##
To address this problem, we have decided to develop a car-rental software, which will serve as a means of communication between rental companies and potential customers. The software aims to enable its users to quickly and effectively provide a platform to scout numerous choices, alternatives, and give the users the option to filter and sort the available vehicles as they please.

## Main Objectives *(Aim)* ##
- To provide a convenient platform for large, premium and small car rental businesses.
- To provide functionality by storing, listing, and booking available vehicles for rent.
- To facilitate the renting process via the use of this software.

## App Description: ##
GoDrive Albania will be designed as a web-based application, Internet accessible. This software will consist of three main modules: Guest, Users, Businesses, and Admin.     
- Guests: these users can view the website and check information regarding the rental options. They can also inquire through the Contact Us page.  
- Users: registered users can log in with an email and password. They are able to book vehicles, view car booking history, edit profile, and post/view reviews.
- Business: these users represent the car-rental companies, who are to post, manage, and delete their various offers on the site.
- Admins: these users manage and have access to everything on the site. This role will be exclusive to developers, who will serve as peacekeepers, ensuring that the website remains functional and that community guidelines are followed.
